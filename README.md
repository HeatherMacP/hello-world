# hello-world
(this is my tutorial repository as I learn GitHub)
I am a technical communicator with proven technical writing and presentation skills developed through a combination of work experience, education, and ongoing contributions to open source documentation. 
I'm a quick study with a strong computer aptitude, and I love learning new concepts and keeping up with technology.
I think one of my biggest skills is my ability to build consensus within teams, by being friendly, emphathetic, and diplomatic. People like me. :)
My key to success is to focus on the end user - whenever possible, I translate customer needs into actionable items.
